**Deliverables:**
- ‚úÖ Medication vs incident correlation data
- ‚úÖ Timeline analysis of events
- ‚úÖ Statistical summaries
- ‚úÖ Data suitable for graph overlays
- ‚úÖ Dashboard-ready API endpoints

---

## Stage 6: React Frontend Development üé®

**Goal:**  
Modern, accessible medical UI with advanced data visualization for seizure/medication correlation analysis

**Prerequisites:**  
Complete Stages 4 & 5 before beginning frontend development

**Tasks:**
- Set up React + TypeScript + Vite development environment with medical-grade component architecture
- Implement JWT-based authentication flow with role-based route protection
- Create patient management dashboard with comprehensive CRUD operations
- Build medical event tracking interface optimized for seizure/episode logging
- Develop medication dosage tracking with visual scheduling and adherence monitoring
- Implement advanced search/filtering interfaces leveraging Stage 4 APIs
- Create sophisticated data visualization dashboards using Stage 5 analytics endpoints
- Build overlay graph system for medication dosage vs medical event correlation analysis
- Add responsive design with accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Implement real-time updates and offline-capable data entry

**Key Frontend Features:**
- **Correlation Visualization**: Interactive overlay graphs showing medication timing vs seizure frequency/severity
- **Timeline Analysis**: Multi-axis charts displaying dosage patterns against episode occurrences
- **Pattern Recognition UI**: Visual indicators for medication effectiveness and optimal dosing windows
- **Medical Episode Logging**: Streamlined forms for rapid seizure/episode documentation during incidents
- **Dosage Impact Analysis**: Before/after comparison charts for medication adjustments
- **Caregiver Dashboard**: Role-specific views for medical staff vs family members

**Technical Architecture:**
- **State Management**: React Query (server state) + Zustand (client state)
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts with custom medical chart components for overlay analysis
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form + Zod validation for medical data integrity
- **Component Design**: Atomic design system with medical-specific components
- **Performance**: Virtualized lists, optimistic updates, medical image optimization

**Development Priority Order:**
1. **Authentication & User Management** (Foundation)
2. **Patient Management Dashboard** (Core functionality)
3. **Medical Event Tracking Interface** (Primary use case)
4. **Medication Dosage Management** (Treatment tracking)
5. **Search & Filtering UI** (Data retrieval)
6. **Data Visualization & Correlation Analysis** (Clinical insights)

**Deliverables:**
- User authentication and role-based navigation system
- Patient management dashboard with medication tracking capabilities
- Medical event logging interface optimized for seizure documentation
- Advanced search and filtering UI with medical-specific parameters
- Interactive correlation dashboards with overlay graph functionality
- Medication dosage vs medical episode impact visualization system
- Mobile-responsive design with accessibility compliance
- Role-based feature access for PRIMARY_USER, SECONDARY_USER, and ADMIN roles
- Real-time data synchronization and offline data entry capabilities
